# Tenzies

## Description

Tenzi is a fast-paced dice game that is designed for two or more players. The game is simple to learn and can be enjoyed by people of all ages. The objective of Tenzi is to roll all ten of their dice to match the same number.

To play Tenzi, each player starts with ten dice. The dice are typically standard six-sided dice, with each face showing a different number from 1 to 6. At the start of the game, everyone rolls their ten dice simultaneously, trying to roll as many of the same number as possible.

After the initial roll, players quickly scan their dice and set aside any dice that match the same number. They then re-roll the remaining dice, aiming to accumulate more of the same number. The process continues until all ten of their dice show the same number.

Tenzies is an online adaptation of the popular game Tenzi, where instead of physically rolling dice, players press a button to simulate the roll. The number of rolls will be displayed on the screen. The less this number the better!
